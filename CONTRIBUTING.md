New questions and topics are also welcome.  


We appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing complex algorithms.
Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

We want your code to be easily understandable by others, so make sure:
1. You comment your code, with the working of the algorithm
2. Link any reference that helped you with the code, for example, a wikipedia page.
3. Help your reader by using descriptive names that can help you to remove redundant comments.
    - Avoid single letter variable names, unless they live for only a few lines.
    - Avoid acronyms.
 4. Most importantly, make sure your code works, and do provide an example the shows its working.
